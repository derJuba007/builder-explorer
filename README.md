## Builder & Explorer

Minecraft is constantly being developed and regularly receives updates that add new content. That's just fantastic. But besides Mojang's hard work, the incredibly creative modding community also delivers content that fits super into the game, partly without losing the vanilla Minecraft feel.

With the modpack **"Builder & Explorer"** we want to improve the two most important elements of the game: Exploring randomly generated worlds and creating your own worlds.

The modpack is based on the Fabric modloader with performance in mind.
